Design
======
This file contains an explanation about how we structured our profiles.

* features/<name>: this is a feature folder, which contains primarily 
USE flags and sets, that instantly enable a certain feature. These are 
intended to be optional, so they should never be referenced by a generic 
profile.

* device/<arch>/<device>: "arch" is self-explanatory, 
"device" refers to a product such as beagleboard or touchboox. Every folder
here is expected to be a sibling of at least the folder directly above.

* release/<release>/<stage>/<platform>: "release" is the appropriate release 
version for your image.  "stage" is the appropriate stage. "device" is as
defined above previously. This profile folder is to be linked to and will
be based on specific downloadable images based on "platform".

* toolchain/<toolchain>/<gcc>/<arch>: this folder is used to modularize
the large number of processor core families which have varying hardware
capabilities along with support as it is added by gcc.

A visual understanding of this can be seen here:

Notes
=====
1. overlay/profiles/neuvoo/parent references /var/lib/neuvoo/portage_profile
which should be a soft link to where normal Gentoo portage profiles resides.
Normally, /usr/portage/profiles.
