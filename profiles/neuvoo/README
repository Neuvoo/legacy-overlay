This file contains an explanation about how we structured our profiles.

* features/<name>: this is a feature folder, which contains primarily 
USE flags and sets, that instantly enable a certain feature. These are 
intended to be optional and set at the user's discretion, so they
should be referenced sparingly by a generic profile.

* <arch>/<device>/<additional purpose>: "arch" is self-explanatory, 
"device" refers to a product such as beagleboard or touchboox, and 
"additional purpose" refers to a broad category such as desktop or 
minimal. Every folder here is expected to be a sibling of at least the 
folder directly above.

* images/<release>/<device>: "release" is the appropriate release
version for your image.  "device" is as defined above previously.
