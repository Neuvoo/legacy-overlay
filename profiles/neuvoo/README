This file contains an explanation about how we structured our profiles.

* features/<name>: this is a feature folder, which contains primarily 
USE flags and sets, that instantly enable a certain feature. These are 
intended to be optional, so they should never be referenced by a generic 
profile.

* <arch>/<device>/<additional purpose>: "arch" is self-explanatory, 
"device" refers to a product such as beagleboard or touchboox, and 
"additional purpose" refers to a broad category such as desktop or 
minimal. Every folder here is expected to be a sibling of at least the 
folder directly above.

* images/<release>/<device>: "release" is the appropriate release 
version for your image.  "device" is as defined above previously. This 
profile folder is never to be linked to, but instead its contents are to 
be used for the /etc/make.profile.neuvoo and /etc/portage folders.
