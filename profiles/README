Profiles here will not work completely just yet. Unfortunately, the 
limitations of portage profiles require us to do a bit of a hack to make 
it work.

* Some profiles link to an official portage profile. Since we don't know 
where that is, you're going to have to tell us. In the directory that 
contains this overlay, run the following command:
ln -s <profile directory, like /usr/portage/profiles> portage_profiles
